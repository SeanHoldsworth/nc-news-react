# Broken News Front End

This is a React front end to my [back end implementation](https://github.com/SeanHoldsworth/nc-news)
of the Northcoders News API. There is a live, hosted version of the interface which can be accessed at:

https://broken-news.netlify.app/

Note that there will be a delay in this starting up because the back end database can take around
30 seconds to become available.
